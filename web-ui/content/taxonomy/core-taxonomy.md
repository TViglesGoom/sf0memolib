# Taxonomy

Broken into groups, taxonomy groups unite conceptually related sets of labels.

## label anatomy

A label or tag may be simple string literal (format: case-sensitive, letters, numbers, dash and underscore characters) or
a string literal followed by a **single** more specific categorization, e.g. `field:cybernetics`, separated by colon.

Specifier obeys same restrictions as original tag literal (format: case-sensitive, letters, numbers, dash and underscore characters only).
